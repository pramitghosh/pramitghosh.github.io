# Traditional EO data processing

- Requires data to be present locally
- Bottleneck for processing large data volumes
  - Bandwidth
  - Computing power
- Cloud-based processing seems the most promising solution
  - Moving code to data is easier than the other way around
- openEO aims to develop a mediating API comprehendible to compliant back-ends and clients

# User-defined Functions (UDF)

A UDF service allows users to run their own code instead of only those provided by the back-ends

# But...

- How usable would such a service be for practical purposes from the PoV of users?
  - Intended users: geographers, ecologists, modellers etc. who wish to run their code on EO data
- Is it possible to improve upon the capabilities offered by existing state-of-the-art infrastructures such as Google Earth Engine (GEE)?

# Overview of methodology

- Prototypical R package `openEO.R.UDF`  (Ghosh and Lahn, 2019) exploring 3 strategies for an UDF service
  - File-based service
  - RESTful service with EO data as JSON arrays
  - RESTful service with EO data as base64-encoded strings
- Evaluated the strategies through quantitative experiments and qualitative study
- The best strategy (using base64-encoded string) was compared with GEE with respect to usability and functionality

## UDF service implementation
Using `stars` (Pebesma, 2018)

# Results

- Implementation using base64-encoded strings offers faster results than other strategies for a variety of operations

# Advantages over GEE: Usability

- R coding style need not be adapted for execution in the cloud
  - Users do not need to change the code written for their local machine drastically
  - No distinction between client- and server-side objects (Gorelick et al., 2017)
- Open source HTTP-based interface with language-agnostic open-source technologies
  - No language-specific clients to interact with the back-end (e.g. JS, Python in GEE)
  - Smooth learning curve for users

# Advantages over GEE: Functionality

- Download, install and use external libraries (R packages) at run-time from CRAN, Github etc.
  - Users not limited to pre-defined functionality
- Support for external data in a variety of formats
  - Possible for users to send supplementary data to the web-service
- External processing support
  - Users can query external processing services (e.g. WPS) over the internet as a part of their UDFs

# Limitations and Future directions

- Functionalities are at the expense of crucial limitations
  - Scalability
  - Security
  - Fault tolerance
- Possible to overcome these without compromising the advantages
- Future directions
  - Parallelization of execution by suitably chunking EO data
  - UDF archive for modular code compatible with multiple back-ends

# Conclusion

- A language-agnostic web-based UDF service could be implemented using open-source and generic technologies in a way that is practically usable by users
  - particularly in the context of the openEO project
- There is room to improve upon existing state-of-the-art infrastructures, such as GEE, and offer additional functionalities
  - requires more research to overcome limitations
