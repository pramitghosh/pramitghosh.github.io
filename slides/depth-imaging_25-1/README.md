# Introduction
These are the slides for presenting the demonstration for the application built for the study project "Depth Imaging". I belonged to the Statistics and Visualization group.

# Figures
Here are some figures that were generated due to the study.

## Floorplan
A floorplan was generated for the study area. A local reference system was established and mapped to the global reference system with the help of immovable objects in the study area as control points.

## Processing trajectory data
Data captured with the help of depth imaging cameras were processed and analyzed. As multiple cameras provided data for the same region, various strategies were used to merge duplicate and erroneous trajectory datasets.

## Trajectory summaries
Statistical data regarding each track were calculated and plotted

## Finding stops
Regions where visitors (in the museum) stopped were computed (and later the closest exhibit to these regions were calculated to determine the popularity of the museum's exhibits)
